            For now go to here <a href='https://github.com/133794m3r/question_answer_library'>
            Question & Answer Github Repo</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future this page will be where you go to actually do the practice questions, but
            that is a large time away from now. Until then you can go there. Or for practice materials
            go to <a href='https://github.com/133794m3r'>My Github Page</a> and be on the look out for
            a link to a repo that'll house my practice materials in pdf form. In the future there'll be a
            full site where you can download things. For now this is a placeholder. To satisfy GH-Pages.
