                    This utility will help you create the questions that will then appear on the client-side website. Also you
                    must do is make sure that you include at least 2 possible answers for the question if it's true/false.
                    Otherwise the minimum amount of answers you should stick with is 3 if at all possible. Units and also class
                    identifiers will be added via a separate page as to not have this one too crowded. This page will be for
                    the creation of questions & answers & rationales.

                <p class="hidden">
                    When writing your questions be sure that they are clearly word. You can use trick questions as in referring
                    to something in both possible ways but you should explain what you're asking. For example, an Anatomy
                    question could be worded as follows. "Lying anteriorly to the dorsal gray horns, and also posteriorly to the
                    ventral gray horns is the ___ horns." The answer here would be the lateral gray horns as they are between
                    the two horns. And Anterior is a synonym for Ventral which both mean "towards the front", and Dorsal/Posterior mean
                    towards the back/behind. Also make sure that the answers are similarly correct. If you try to confuse the
                    student utilizing tricks like these you may end up tricking yourself or at least I did.

                <p class="hidden">
                    When you start creating a question. You first have to select the material's subject-matter. Then you have
                    to select what chapter questions are concerning. If you do not already see the chapter listed, you have to
                    click the "add chapter" button to add it to the list of possible chapters for the materials. After that you
                    have to write the question. Next you write the answers, make sure you do at least 3 answers if you're not
                    doing a true/false question as by default if you only list two answers it'll make it be a true/false question.
                    You also need to make sure to click the "checkbox" beside the answers you've written to mark that one as the
                    correct one.

                <p class="hidden">
                    You can also add more answers besides the default 3 by clicking the "+" beside the answers text-box on the
                    page. You can add additional answers up until a total of 5 as the 6th answer will always be a "I Don't Know"
                    so that the person using the system can request the answer instead of just guessing and thus it won't count
                    against them as much as if they had gotten it wrong.

                <p class="hidden">
                    Rationales are linked to each of the questions and can be added by clicking on the button that says "add
                    rationales." These explain why each answer is either right or wrong. You should add at least one rationale
                    for the correct answer explaining why it is the correct answer. If you're doing multiple answers it's best
                    to make it so that you have an answer explaining why each one is right or wrong. The rationales also link
                    back to the answers themselves. E.g. Answer 1 -> Rationale 1, Ans 2->Rationale 2... etc. They are linked
                    of course. And the one that's correct would link to the correct one. Before the rationales the text
                    whether it is wrong or not is automatically prepended. E.g {Answer_Number} is incorrect because
                    {Rational_Text}.
